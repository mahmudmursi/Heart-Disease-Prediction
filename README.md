# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Among various life-threatening diseases, heart disease has garnered great attention in medical research. The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task, which can offer an automated prediction about the patient's heart condition so that further treatment can be effective. The diagnosis of heart disease is usually based on the patient's signs, symptoms and physical examination. Several factors increase the risk of heart diseases, such as smoking habits, body cholesterol level, family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.


A major challenge faced by health care organizations, such as hospitals and medical centres, is the provision of quality services at affordable costs. The quality service implies diagnosing patients properly and administering effective treatments. The available heart disease database consists of both numerical and categorical data. Before further processing, cleaning and filtering are applied to these records in order to filter the irrelevant data from the database. The proposed system can determine exactly hidden knowledge, i.e., patterns and relationships associated with heart disease, from a historical heart disease database. It can also answer the complex queries for diagnosing heart disease; therefore, it can be helpful to health care practitioners to make intelligent clinical decisions. Results showed that the proposed system has its unique potency in realizing the objectives of the defined mining goals.

#Data

Some of the input features that we would be considering in this example are blood pressure, chest pain type and cholestrol levels. This is just a sample dataset with 303 rows. This is created just to understand different classification machine learning algorithms and sklearn implementation of them. Below is the link where you can find the source of the data. Thanks to 'kaggle' for providing this data.
